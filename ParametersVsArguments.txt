PARAMETER → PLACEHOLDER (This means a placeholder belongs to the function naming and be used in the function body)
ARGUMENT → ACTUAL VALUE (This means an actual value which is passed by the function calling)

from a function's perspective:

A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

Rule:
Always Remember that:
Arguments are passed while parameters are received.
