In Java, the concepts of **mutability** and **immutability** refer to whether an object’s state can be changed after it is created.

- **Mutable objects**: These objects can have their state (data) changed after creation.
- **Immutable objects**: Once created, these objects cannot be modified; any change will result in the creation of a new object.

Here’s a table to summarize the differences between **mutable** and **immutable** objects in Java:

| Feature                     | **Mutable Objects**                        | **Immutable Objects**                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**               | Objects whose state can be changed after creation. | Objects whose state cannot be changed once created. |
| **Examples in Java**         | `StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`, `ArrayList`, `HashMap` | `String`, `Integer`, `LocalDate`, `BigInteger` |
| **Modifiable**               | Yes, you can modify the object’s content.  | No, any attempt to modify will create a new object. |
| **Thread Safety**            | Usually **not thread-safe** unless synchronized. | Thread-safe by default (because they can’t be modified). |
| **Memory Usage**             | Efficient for multiple modifications since the same object is reused. | Higher memory usage for frequent changes since new objects are created on every modification. |
| **Use Case**                 | When frequent changes are needed, e.g., appending strings, altering collection data. | When you need data to remain constant, e.g., as keys in `HashMap` or constants in an application. |
| **Creation of New Object**   | No new object is created when the state is modified. | A new object is created for every modification attempt. |
| **Examples of Modification** | `StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello"); sb.append(" World");` | `String s = "Hello"; s = s.concat(" World"); // new object` |
| **Performance**              | Faster for modifications since no new object is created. | Slower for frequent modifications due to object creation. |
| **Equality**                 | Can change, so equality comparison (`equals()`) might not be consistent over time. | Equality remains consistent because the state does not change. |
| **Storage**                  | Stored in the regular heap memory.         | Immutable objects like `String` may be stored in the **String Pool** (special heap memory area). |
| **Usage as Keys in Maps**    | Not recommended, as changes can affect hashing and comparison. | Suitable for use as keys in `HashMap` because the state cannot change, preserving hash codes. |

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Immutable objects** are ideal when you need constant values or when thread safety is a concern.
- **Mutable objects** are suitable for scenarios where performance matters, especially when frequent updates or modifications are needed.

### Examples:
#### **Immutable Object Example (`String`):**
```java
public class ImmutableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Hello";
        str = str.concat(" World"); // creates a new object
        System.out.println(str); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

#### **Mutable Object Example (`StringBuilder`):**
```java
public class MutableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.append(" World"); // modifies the same object
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

In general, choose **immutable** objects when immutability is required (like constants), and **mutable** objects when frequent changes are needed.
